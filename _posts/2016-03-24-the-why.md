## a little background
Although trained and practiced in communication, marketing, and government affairs I love technology. Much of experience as been in between the general public and scientists or engineers, explaining the benefits of a piece of technology to the public or explaining the needs or desires of regular people to those developing the "next big thing."

Here I am again. This time as a member of the [local chapter](http://friendlycode.org) of [Code for America (CfA)](https://www.codeforamerica.org/why-government),  a national nonprofit that believes government can work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century. We use data and develop technology to further local governments priorities of creating healthy, prosperous, and safe communities.

Currently [Code for America draws on the power of over 50,000 volunteers working 134 communities](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/numbers/) primarily in the United States. Another multiplier affect for the impact of Code for America is our belief in developing open source solutions. Practically this means that something developed for one city can be redeployed for another, with resources spent on improving and localizing the application rather then writing from scratch. As you can imagine this improves delivery time and continually improves the code base.

## so why are you doing this?

Right. So I am a an enthusiastic [kinesthetic learner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesthetic_learning). I really wanted to have a basic understanding of the underlying process of open source technology. With previous web development experience, my first stop was to create this simple site into which I could practice and grow. Along the way I would also share what I has helped me and how I use many of the same tools that my coding friends use.

## hey this is cool

Once I opened the door to learning open source I found much more then code was being created and managed this way. Projects, companies, and even governments are becoming open source and utilizing agile processes for operating and governing.

Back to my CfA chapter, Friendly Code, while we meet twice a month we are very much a virtual organization. To make significant progress on projects work often happens between the meetings. Also, some members are unable to make meetings but want to contribute. An open process for making contributions is perfect for our work.

Over the past six months we have begun utilizing [Slack](https://slack.com) as our open communication tool. While [Github](https://github.com/) is being used for code repositories, it is also being used for documentation (via [github's wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/)) and light project management through the use of [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io/).
